The Hysleria Album Visualizer is a Python program that uses the pyAudioAnalysis library to read the beats per minute (BPM) of a song and then uses that information to create a visual representation of the song's rhythm. The program can be used to create album covers, music videos, or any other type of visual art that is inspired by music.

To use the Hysleria Album Visualizer, first install the pyAudioAnalysis library. Then, open the alb_viz.py file in a text editor and change the path to the music folder to the location of your music files. Finally, run the program and select the song you want to visualize. The program will then create a visual representation of the song's rhythm.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the Hysleria Album Visualizer works:

1. The program first imports the pyAudioAnalysis library.
2. The program then gets a list of all the files in the music folder.
3. The program shuffles the list of files.
4. The program loads the files in the shuffled order.
5. The program reads the BPM of each song.
6. The program uses the BPM to create a visual representation of the song's rhythm.
7. The program displays the visual representation of the song's rhythm.

The Hysleria Album Visualizer is a powerful tool that can be used to create beautiful and unique visual art. The program is easy to use and can be used by anyone, regardless of their programming experience.
