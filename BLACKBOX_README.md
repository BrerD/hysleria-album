The Hysleria Album Visualizer is a Python program that uses the pyAudioAnalysis library to read the beats per minute (BPM) of a song and then uses that information to create a visual representation of the music. The program uses the turtle library to draw a heart shape that moves and changes color in time with the music.

To use the Hysleria Album Visualizer, first open the alb_viz.py file in a Python editor. Then, click the "Run" button to start the program. The program will first ask you to select a song from the music folder. Once you have selected a song, the program will start reading the BPM of the song and then create the visual representation of the music.

The visual representation of the music is a heart shape that moves and changes color in time with the music. The speed of the heart shape is determined by the BPM of the song, and the color of the heart shape changes based on the volume of the song.

The Hysleria Album Visualizer is a fun and easy way to visualize the music you are listening to. The program is also a great way to learn more about the BPM of music and how it can be used to create visual representations of music.
